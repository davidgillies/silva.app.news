SilvaNewsNetwork changes

  2.2

    Features

    Features

      - Made layout of the INV (Inline News Viewer) more generic using standard 
        Silva html classes

      - RSS Aggregator public view: removed hard coded table and replaced with

      - Fixed i18n support

      - AgendaItems spanning over a period of more than one month are now

  2.1.2

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed support for code sources (external sources) in news items.

  2.1.1
  
    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed some documentation issues: some version numbers were wrong.

  2.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Added upgrader for a specific Zope 2.8.x issue, where some ZCatalog
        indexes had a new attribute defined, but the upgrader for that 
        attribute wasn't executed when required.

    Features

      - SilvaNewsNetwork now works on (and depends on!) Silva 1.5.

  2.0.2

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed Kupu ExternalSources support in news items. Thanks to Andrew
        Altepeter.

      - Fixed bug where upgrader was registered for the wrong meta type. Thanks
        to Marc Petitmermet.

      - Added dummy upgrader for 1.2, which makes that the upgrades are
        actually ran when the data version is 1.2 (works around a bug in
        Silva's upgrade registry).

  2.0.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Added missing upgraders for 1.3 (or below) to 2.0.

  2.0

    Features

      - Kupu editor support for news items (replacing the widget editor)

      - Name change from SilvaNews to SilvaNewsNetwork

  1.3

    Features

      - In each item in a news viewer, the first image of the item's content 
        (if available) is displayed as a thumbnail.

      - Removed all tables from the public views to more easily allow styling
        and layouting with CSS (note that this changes the layout of the public
        views!)

      - Added a new checkbox in Agenda Items, 'display time', to control 
        whether the time part of start and end date/time is displayed in
        the public views, allowing times of 00:00 to be displayed.

      - Added a couple of new fields to service_news to allow displaying
        dates and months in a certain locale and format (this is a global
        setting rather than a per-user one, because Silva content currently
        can not be presented in more than one language it doesn't make sense
        to display dates and months in different languages).

      - Added a new field 'display_datetime' to news items, rather than using
        the publication date/time to determine if and where an item is
        displayed in a news viewer, this display date is used, e.g. allowing
        re-publishing of an item without moving it in the public view of news
        viewers.

      - Agenda items are now displayed according to the end datetime, if 
        available, so that an item disappears from the list of 'current events'
        when it ends rather than when it starts.

      - Subjects and target audiences now have a title, which allows changing
        the way they are displayed without having to update stored references
        to them (so you can now 'change a subject' and still have newsviewers
        display the correct list of items).

      - Rather than displaying the first subheader encountered in the news item
        and the first paragraph encountered (which enforced a certain structure
        on news item content to make the viewers display the items correctly)
        news viewers now display the first *bit* of the news item, regardless
        of the type of elements that contains. Note that this requires some
        changes in the public templates (the subheader() and lead() methods 
        have been replaced by one called 'get_intro').

    Bugs fixed

      - The 'number of items to display' field on news viewers used to limit
        the number of items displayed in the archive, which made certain items
        not get displayed anymore, this is not fixed.

  1.2

    Features

      - Updated SilvaNews to work with Silva 1.2

  1.1

    Bugs fixed

      - Changed the names of indexes so they're less likely to clash with 
        names of user-generated objects - SEE UPGRADE.txt!

  1.0

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed 'select all' in edit tabs.

      - Fixed some small template issues so it works correctly with Silva 1.0.

      - Problem in some DateTime argument formatting solved that made viewing 
        certain objects result in an IOError when Silva was running on Windows
        Zope installations.

  0.9.1

    Bugs fixed
 
      - Silva News really depends on Silva Document, not just Silva core.

  0.9

    Features

      - RSS 1.0 overviews on NewsViewers and Aggregators.
        By adding /rss to the URL of a NewsViews, one will
        get the RSS 1.0 feed for this viewer or aggregator.

      - Removed the RSSViewer (replaced by the RSSAggregator).

    Bugs fixed

      - Fixed just about all Silva 0.9.3 conversion issues.

    Note: SilvaNews 0.9 is incompatible with previously released
    versions.
